# Interviewing

## Phone Scereen

## 


always do this via phone, not zoom. eliminates bias of on screen nervousness and puts everyone in the same position
-   General ideas:
    -   "**Questions have very high signal value compared to most anything else you can get from a candidate**" - from Graham Duncan
        -   During interviews, I try to create a stillness that helps separate signal from noise, elephants from riders. The easiest way to create conditions of stillness is to talk very little. It also helps to have the candidate you’re trying to see clearly ask you questions. **Questions have very high signal value compared to most anything else you can get from a candidate**
        -   This is harder to do in practice than you might think—you need to make the candidate feel safe enough to ask their true questions, and you need to answer concisely or you’ll run out of time (which is particularly hard if the person asks good questions). I write down each question and sometimes respond with “I’ll answer, but first I’m curious, why did you ask that?” **I’m looking for the felt sense of a “hungry mind” based on the way their questions flow. That’s very hard to fake**
        -   Try to unburden the interview of too many assumptions you have about the role. I like asking up-front, “So what criteria would you use if you were the one hiring someone for this role?” I love this question because of how unexpected the answers are. Some are tactical when you expect abstraction. Some improve your own criteria. Some use jargon that may indicate they are playing someone else’s game versus authoring their own. All are quite revealing.
            -   “captures the other persons’s definition of success, and captures some nuance that you wouldn’t have even known to ask about”
