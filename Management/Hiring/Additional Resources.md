# Hiring Links and Resources

The following resources are a core part of the process for [[How I Hire]]. I've found an incredible amount of inspiration from other sources. My core process is very much a mix of processes I've stolen from other people and made my own. The following section is a dive into each of the sources with relevant links that are helpful.

I've tried to link directly to the related resource in the rest of the guide, but thought it would be helpful to have quick summaries of each in one spot so I can find what I'm looking for quickly. 

### Books and Articles
- GH Smartâ€™s [Topgrading](https://topgrading.com/)
	- The easier, summarized version is the book [Who](https://whothebook.com/) (the simplified version of Topgrading)
	- Topgrading was the first real hiring process I dove into when I was trying to understand how to hire well. It made a deep impression on my thought process. 
	- Big takeaways:
		- The concept of A, B and C talent in a particular position. Someone can be an A in one role and a C in a different role or at a different pay band. It's all about performance as compared to others you could hire at the same level of pay. A closely related concept is the idea of [Wins Above Replacement]() or "how long would it take to find someone of comparable quality or better to replace this person?"
		- Past behavior is a better indicator of future success than any philosophical discussions or answers to specific interview questions. You're looking for patterns of behavior repeated across jobs. 
		- While it may seem tedious, going to into excrutiating detail about past jobs quickly separates people who have repeated history of overperforming in jobs are more likely to overperform in yours. People who blame others, don't take responsiblity, or run into problems frequently are likely to do the same in your job. 
		- In your personal career, be very careful about taking positions where you can't be an A player. Upward career trajetories are built on repeatedly moving from A position to A position to create a history of performance.

	- If someone wants to learn how I hire quickly, I point them to  or a quick background on [Adler's process](https://www.greenhouse.io/blog/performance-based-hiring-methods)
	- Big Takeaways:
		- Before thinking about compensation differences, why is your job 30% better than what they're doing today? If it's not, you'll have a hard time recruiting or you'll go fishing in the wrong ponds. 
		- Plan out how you're going to judge the performance of your future hire before you write the job description. What do you need them to do for your organization? How are you going to measure that? How are you going to onboard them to be able to hit those metrics? Only hire once you can answer those questions or else you don't know what you're hiring for. 
		- The quality of your hires is the function of two different processes - the interviewing process and the recruiting process. If you aren't sticking a lot of good people at the top, you'll end up lowering your standards to get someone hired. Learn how to recruit. 
		- Your initial recruiting messages (outbound linkedin messages, cold emails, phone calls, etc) should be around first getting them on the bus - just having the conversation - and then should be your 30% better pitch. Once they're hooked and interested, then you can screen them to see if they're actually a good fit for your organization. Think like a recruiter. 
- Korn Ferry's [Four Dimensional Executive Assessment](https://www.kornferry.com/content/dam/kornferry/docs/article-migration/KF4D_Executive_Manual_FINAL.pdf)
- [The Rare Find](https://www.amazon.com/Rare-Find-Great-Talent-Stands/dp/1591845629) 
	- Helps me ensure I'm not passing over high potential candidates with broken or non-traditional resume.
