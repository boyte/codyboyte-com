# How I Hire

I've spent a fair amount of time over the years reading about and learning about different hiring practices to make my own processes and thoughts better nuanced to hire good people. While I've learned a lot and it's made me a better hiring manager, it was hard to explain to other people. 

This is my attempt to break down my process into steps other people can replicate. 

To be fair, there is a lot here. I don't expect you to follow it all - I don't follow all of it for anyone. Some of these pieces are just notes. But it's all be useful for me in rethinking my hiring processes. 

## Context
- **Description**: This is the process and notes around how I hire a new employee for my team. It's abstracted out of any individual job into the parts of the process that result in a good hire for nearly any position.
-   **Output**: The fundamental output of this process is a new employee for a position open on my team.
-   **Requirements**:
	- Hiring Group
		- Hiring Manager
		- 1-2 other managers or trusted employees
		- 1 person outside of your division
		- Recruiter if possible for scheduling
	- Rough Budget for available position
	- Onboarding Processes setup/understood


## Background




### Limitations and Exceptions

This process isn't really about training employees, managing them as employees, or firing them. This is a process to ensure I regularly hire exceptional talent.

Additionally, most of this process is built for the requirements of working in a very large company where you have a lot of people around you who are impacted by the person you hire. In my current role, the people I hire may or may not be on my team in future years, so I need to ensure that I'm hiring people who are a good fit for the organization, not just a good fit for me personally.

This process is long and detailed - on purpose. It works very well when you're trying to hire a few people occasionally and the downside risk of a bad hire is worse than the time lag of not hiring. This process does not work well for high volume hiring where a bad hire can be pushed out quickly and replaced with other talent.

 For example, a bad hire as a Solutions Engineer can take 3-6 months to recognize, 6+ months to give adequate time for them to correct their behavior, another 6 months to encourage them to take another role or push them out, and then 3-6 months to hire again. If we hire the wrong person, we've lost 18+ months of training time and the opportunity cost of missed deals during that time which is literally millions in revenue.

On the other end of the spectrum, hiring people to write low-end, SEO articles or do basic data entry can cost you $50-100 or less per article or a few bucks an hour. If you get it wrong, you cut bait and move on to find more. It can often be a better strategy to hire multiple people at the same time, see who does best, fire the underperformers and get more people in the cycle. This process does not solve for high volume, low risk hiring.

The other exception to this process that can result in a shorter hiring timeline is when there is very good identified talent that we have to move fast to get onboard. We should do an abbreviated version of this - a panel interview to go through their work history, a detailed understanding of what they're trying to do going forward, etc - but may skip the presentation or in-depth reference checks. We'll still do the reference checks, but as part of an onboarding process to understand how to handle them as employees rather than as part of the evaluation to hire.

## Risks

The biggest risks in hiring generally are around bias and jumping to conclusions too early, then only focusing on the things that support the conclusions we've already decided. In theory, this process should help reduce bias in the hiring process, but it doesn't do it automatically. You still have to make space for people and let them open up before you decide they're wrong.

The other big risk of this process is that it's very different from a normal process and therefore can either take too long or scare people a bit. Without the right context or awareness of where the candidate is in the decision process, you can lose good candidates to other companies who move faster.

One final note: I've seen a lot of managers who will find a great candidate and then fail to hire them because they're intimidated by the talent. Be very careful that you're not passing on someone because they're better than you, instead try to find the ways you can put them in a position to succeed and to help your team get to another level.


## Preparing to Hire

The work you put into understanding what you're trying to hire is some of the most important work you can do. I often talk to other managers who are in such a rush to get someone in seat that they haven't properly thought through exactly what their team needs, how they'll onboard the new employee, or how they'll pitch the opportunity to their ideal candidates. It makes the whole process much harder and more random than it needs to be. 

### Job Prep Document
For every job, I write up a job prep document that covers a bunch of different categories to ensure I know exactly what I'm looking for. I'll dive into each in a minute, but here are the core categories: 

- Role Key Performance Indicators
- Expectations of a good hire (90 days, 12 months, 3-5 years)
- Role Competency Model
- Job Evaluation Model
- Intended onboarding process
- Employee Value Proposition
- Formal job description
